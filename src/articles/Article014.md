## The Importance of a CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. It is a practice that automates the software development process, from building and testing to deployment.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. The main goal of CI is to prevent integration problems.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment.
