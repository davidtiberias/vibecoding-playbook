# How to Summarize Your Entire Chat with Any LLM

When working with large language models (LLMs), conversations can quickly become long and complex. Summarizing the entire chat into a clear, structured format helps you see the flow of dialogue at a glance, making it easier to analyze, document, or share.

One effective method is to transform the conversation into a **two-column table**:

- **User**: Simplified version of your request or message
- **LLM**: Simplified version of the model’s response

This approach distills the essence of each exchange without losing the overall narrative.

## Why Summarize Chats?

- **Clarity**: Long conversations are condensed into digestible snapshots.
- **Analysis**: You can track how questions evolve and how the model responds.
- **Documentation**: Useful for teaching, auditing, or creating workflow guides.
- **Sharing**: A table format is easy to present in reports or articles.

## The Instruction to Use

To get an LLM to produce this summary, you need a precise instruction. Here’s a template:

```
Take the entire conversation between me and you.
Summarize each turn into simplified text.
Output the result as a Markdown table with two columns: "User" and "LLM".
In the "User" column, write my simplified requests.
In the "LLM" column, write your simplified responses.
```

## Example Output

| User                     | LLM                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| What is B                | Explanation of B            |
| Write this as an article | Article draft with headings |

## The Intent Behind This Instruction

The goal is not just to shorten the chat, but to **capture its rhythm and meaning**. By reducing each turn to a short phrase, you create a high-level map of the conversation. This makes it easier to revisit past discussions, identify patterns, and repurpose content for documentation or training.
