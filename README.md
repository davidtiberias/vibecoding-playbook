## What is This?

This is an interactive website I built to document and explain the **Vibecoding Playbook** - a structured, disciplined method for building software using multiple AI tools.

The goal of this project is to provide a clear, visual guide that anyone can use to understand the concepts of deterministic, verification-driven AI development.

## Why Did I Build This?

While working with modern AI, I noticed it's easy to get unpredictable results or have the AI lose context, leading to errors and wasted time. I developed the Vibecoding Playbook to solve this by imposing a strict process with a few key principles:

- **Using the Right Tool for the Job:** Assigning different AIs to specific tasks they excel at.
- **Forcing Context Resets:** Regularly clearing the AI's memory to ensure it's always working with the most current code.
- **Enforcing Strict Rules (Invariants):** Creating rules that govern the process to ensure stability and predictable outcomes.

This website is the visualization "playbook" for that workflow.

## What You'll Find on the Site

When you visit the website, you can explore three main areas:

1.  **The Workflow Map:** An interactive, step-by-step guide through the entire development process.
2.  **System Invariants:** A simple explanation of the core rules that make the workflow reliable.
3.  **Tool Analysis:** A reference table comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each AI tool used.

This GitHub repository simply holds the source code. **The real experience is on the website itself.**
